This is a Database based Mobile Application Prototype for a Car Wash Booking System with Enhanced Security Final Year Group Research Project Prototype . The prototype was to be presented to panel at the end of a 16 week module duration period

Project Overview: The Car Wash Booking System with Enhanced Security project tackles critical security vulnerabilities commonly found in car wash booking systems. By integrating multi-factor authentication (MFA) and secure notification alerts, this system aims to boost user trust and maintain system integrity. Developed by Team Champion as part of the Mini-Dissertation for the BSc in Information Technology (Mobile Application and Web Services) at Eduvos, this project enhances operational efficiency, user convenience, and data security.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for secure access.
Notification Alerts: Real-time updates on bookings, cancellations, and disruptions.
Booking Management: Easy scheduling, modification, and cancellation of bookings.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design for seamless navigation.
Data Security: Encryption and secure communication protocols to protect user data.
